# GraphQL

This project integrates GraphQL with the Django framework using Graphene-Django to create a flexible and efficient API. Instead of traditional REST endpoints, the application exposes a single GraphQL endpoint that allows clients to query and mutate data dynamically. The backend is built with Django models, and Graphene maps these models into GraphQL types. This setup improves performance by allowing clients to request only the data they need, making it ideal for modern frontend applications like React or Vue.js.
